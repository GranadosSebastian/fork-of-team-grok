# Abstract Class Ticket


# Vendor Ticket (Source of truth) === New Draw! Automated by RNJesus
- Randomly generated int[] -> no setter
- Randomly generated int powerball -> no setter  
- As part of the Vendor ticket constructor, the random int[] must be made as well as the powerball chosen

# Customer Ticket (What is chosen)
- we NEED setters and getters for the int[] and powerball int 


# Verifying Wins
- Date for Vendor Ticket and Customer ticket must be identical first
- Loop through ALL customer tickets with IDENTICAL DATE => Compare to vendor ticket with date
